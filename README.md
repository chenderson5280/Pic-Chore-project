# Pic-Chore-project
Flatiron - Capstone project

Pic-chore is a mobile app with camera functionality and chat funtionality between users. The goal of this app is to track chores through visual aid. Each time a picture of a chore is taken, a chat is created between users. Users then can chat about the displayed photo taken of the chore to be done. Once the chore has been completed, there is a "Submit" button to be pressed that allows the user who took the photo to grade it. Grades range from 1-5 stars. Stars at the end of the week will tally up, and affect the average allowance payed out.
