# Pic-Chore-project
Flatiron - Capstone project

Pic-chore is a mobile app with camera functionality and chat funtionality between users. The goal of this app is to track chores through visual aid. Each time a picture of a chore is taken, a chat is created between users. Users then can chat about the displayed photo taken of the chore to be done. Once the chore has been completed, there is a "Submit" button to be pressed that allows the user who took the photo to grade it. Grades range from 1-5 stars. Stars at the end of the week will tally up, and affect the average allowance payed out.

<h1> SCREENS / STEPS <h1>
<h3> Login Screen<h3>
<p>This is the login screen with full AUTH via Firebase. To login in you will need an account with valid email and password. If you do not have an account, you will need to create one by pressing the 'Sign Up' button at the bottom. </p>

<br>
<h3> Register Screen<h3>
<p>Here is what the register screen looks like. A user will create an account with these 4 entries. One for Name; can be full name or nick name. The next two entries will also be used for loging in: email and password. And finally we have profile pic, were a user can upload any photo for their account. The photo will display as a circular avatar. Once all the information is in, the user will push the 'Register' button to create the account and be re-directed to their home screen. Also, I have the 'Back it up' button to return to the Login Screen. </p>

<h3> Chores / Home Screen<h3>
<p>Welcome to the home screen. The main purpose of this screen is to see all chores still waiting to be complete. You will notice the user's avatar at the top-middle. Chores listed below and organized by most recent at the top. There is a 'LogOut' button to exit the app, also a camera and pencil button. The camera will just simply bring up the camera. The pencil will prompt the user to create a new chore to be done. #smileykitty </p>

<h3> Create Screen <h3>
<p> Here we have the Create Screen where the user can create a new chore to be done. Very simple design here; only one option for the user interact with. With an example below; also plays as the directions/onboarding process (teaching the user how to use to app). Once a chore is named and created, by pressing the 'Create Chore' button, the camera screen will pop up allowing the user to take a picture of the chore named. Also the user will have the option to take multiple pictures for a single chore. </p>

<h3> Camera Screen <h3>
<p> Next, the Camera Screen. Simple design again, with only one button for capturing a photo. A notification will pop up asking for the app to have permission to your phone's camera. After capturing as many photos as the user wants, they will be promted to return to the Home Screen where they will see their newly created chore. Tapping on the chore will bring up the Chore Screen. </p>
